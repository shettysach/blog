This is a simple blog made by converting markdown into static HTML.<br/>

- [`pulldown_cmark`](https://crates.io/crates/pulldown-cmark) - Converts markdown to html
- [`pulldown_latex`](https://crates.io/crates/pulldown-latex) - LaTeX to MathML
- [`syntect`](https://crates.io/crates/syntect) - Provides syntax highlighting

Work in progress.
More features such as blog structuring and search engine optimization will be added.
